# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
In this analysis, we perfomred an analysis on a kickstarter fundraising campaign with Excel software to detect trends.
In categorical analysis, there seem to be the largest venu for the campaign (Chart 1).

During the campaign, May was the most successful compared to other months of the year. On the other hand, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched (Cahrt 2).

In the descriptive analysis of the campaigns data, the mean of goals and pledged are near the third quartile. This trend follows the same distribution in the subsets. Nevertheless, the standard deviation values are larger than the mean Therefore, everything value below the mean is considered "close" to the center but some large values are driving all of these distributions nd the standard deviations are nearly twice than the interquartile in each distribution, except in the failed Kickstarters, where the standard deviation is closer to three times the IQR (Table 1).

The study plots show that the mean campaign goal is around £4,000. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, and one can probably try to get a play produced for less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged . The dots outside the plots indicate the presence of some failed Kickstarters with really high goals (Chart 3).
